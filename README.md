# calculator
First calculator project with just JavaScript.

This project was created using the tutorial from Web Dev Simplefied youtube channel. 
Was used simple HTML and CSS with some importants concepts of programming, such as classes and functions.
The ideia was just to get back to practice JS and the basics of it.
